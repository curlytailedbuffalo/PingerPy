# PingerPy
A python version of the Host Pinger exe 

When looking into the Smartthings HostPinger Smartapp I wanted a way to be able to run it without having to use a windows machine or any fancy programs to run the EXE file from linux or mac.
This is where PingerPy came from - a python version of the Host Pinger EXE.
Once configured this will work with the Host Pinger Smartapp to display the server status of configured hosts.
